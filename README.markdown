What's In This Fork?
---

I'm forking Michael's gem because I want to give it a more idiomatically Ruby style. Will this happen? We'll see!


Description
---

A Smalltalk-like Method Finder for Ruby. Provided with a receiver, a
desired result and possibly some arguments, it will list all methods
that produce the result when called on the receiver with the arguments.

Usage
---

    >> Methodfinder.find(10,1,3)
    => [:%, :<=>, :>>, :[], :modulo, :remainder]
    >> MethodFinder.find("abc","ABC")
    => [:swapcase, :swapcase!, :upcase, :upcase!]
    >> MethodFinder.find(10,100,2)
    => [:**]
    >> MethodFinder.find(['a','b','c'],['A','B','C']) { |x| x.upcase }
    => [:collect, :collect!, :map, :map!]

Todo
---

* Redirect `stdout` and `stderr` to a StringIO object instead of `/dev/null` unless someone tells me that the latter works on Windows. 
* Maybe add some sort of method blacklist so they wonâ€™t get tried in the block.


Thanks
---

* Matthem Lucas for packaging it as a gem.
